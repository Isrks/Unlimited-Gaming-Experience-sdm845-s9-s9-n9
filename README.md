Hi, the objective of this module for magisk is to disable the performance restriction due to temperature when starting a game that requires too many resources, such as CoD Mobile, Genshin Impact, PUBG Mobile, etc.

Specific features of this module:

 - Disables CPU performance limiter due to temperature.
 - Disable GPU performance limiter due to temperature.
 - Disables automatic brightness reduction due to temperature.
 - Enables the use of all CPU cores without frequency limit for all games (Without the module the games are limited to a frequency of 1056Mhz in the large CPU cores)
 - Enables the use of all cores in all tasks.
 - GPU frequency always at maximum while screen is on (This feature is temporary, I will change it when I find a better way to use the GPU to the maximum in certain tasks)
