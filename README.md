Magisk Module.

This module has only been tested on Android 10 (OneUI 2.5).

Hi, the objective of this module for magisk is to disable the performance restriction due to temperature when starting a game that requires too many resources, such as CoD Mobile, Genshin Impact, PUBG Mobile, etc.
This module can drain a lot of battery in games that require a lot of performance.

Specific features of this module:

 - Disables CPU performance limiter due to temperature.
 - Disable GPU performance limiter due to temperature.
 - Disables automatic brightness reduction due to temperature.
 - Enables the use of all CPU cores without frequency limit for all games (Without the module the games are limited to a frequency of 1056Mhz in the large CPU cores).
 - Enables the use of all cores in all tasks.
 - GPU frequency always at maximum while screen is on (This feature is temporary, I will change it when I find a better way to use the GPU to the maximum in certain tasks).

For you to notice the improvements of this module, your device must have more than 15% battery, since due to certain limitations, the device blocks high performance when the battery is very low.

It is recommended that you uninstall or disable any other module that "claims to remove performance limits due to temperature" as it may not work properly with this module.

I have tested my module with Game Home, Game Booster and Game Optimizing enabled, and apparently it does not have any problem with these applications, so you do not need to uninstall or disable these applications, however, keep in mind that if you use Game Plugins from samsung, some features of the app may not be available due to the use of my module.

If you are going to use my modifications in your projects please give me credits.

In case the module leaves your device in bootloop, to remove it you must enter recovery mode and go to the following address (/ data / adb / modules /) and delete the folder "UnlimitedGamingExperienceByIsrks", after that you can restart and your device will start normally.

I am not responsible for damage to your device,, you, third parties, and any other type of damage, use at your own risk.

Sorry about my English, I used a translator to write this.
